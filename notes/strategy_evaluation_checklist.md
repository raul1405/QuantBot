# QuantBot Strategy Evaluation Checklist

**Strategy Version:** v2.1-debugged  
**Evaluation Date:** 2025-12-09  
**Evaluator:** Automated Backtest Engine (Strict Out-of-Sample)  

---

> [!WARNING]
> **CRITICAL FAILURE DETECTED**
> Previous validation results were found to be contaminated by In-Sample (Training) data.
> Strict Out-of-Sample (OOS) testing reveals the strategy **does not generalize** and generates 0 alpha on unseen data.

## Root Cause Analysis

1.  **Look-Ahead Bias via In-Sample Backtesting**: The original `quant_backtest.py` pipeline trained the Alpha Engine on the first 80% of data, but then generated signals and backtested on the *entire* dataset. This meant 80% of the "backtest" was simply the model recalling patterns it had already memorized.
2.  **Overfitting**: The model achieves high accuracy (75-80%) on training data but drops to random chance (39%) or silence (0 trades) on unseen data.
3.  **Feature Stationarity**: The current feature set (Z-scores, rolling means) may not be robust enough for regime changes in the OOS period.

## 1. Return & Efficiency Metrics

### 1.1 Basic Performance
- **CAGR**: 0% (OOS)
- **Status**: Strategy fails to generate returns on unseen data.

### 1.2 Risk-Adjusted Returns
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -1.08 (Negative)
- **Sortino Ratio**: -0.43 (Negative)
- **Conclusion**: The strategy takes risk (volatility) but earns no excess return.

## 2. Statistical Significance

- **t-stat**: Insignificant (close to 0 or negative).
- **vs Random Walk**: Strategy performs *worse* than or equal to a random walk in OOS testing.

## Next Steps (Remediation)

The current strategy is **NOT READY** for deployment. Immediate actions required:

1.  **Implement Walk-Forward Optimization (WFO)**:
    -   Instead of a static 80/20 split, implement a rolling window (e.g., Train 1 year, Test 1 month, slide forward).
    
2.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    -   The XGBoost model needs regularization (lower max_depth, higher lambda).
    -   Probability thresholds (0.65) are likely too high for OOS data where the model is less confident.
    
3.  **Feature Selection**:
    -   Remove noisy features that lead to overfitting.
    -   Focus on stationarity (use log-returns, fractional differentiation).

4.  **Target Definition**:
    -   The current target (Future Return > 0.001) might be too noisy. Try labelling based on ATR multiples or trend direction.
