live_config.json
# Note: We usually exclude config with secrets, but for this specific "Plug & Play" request where I just added secrets to json for convenience, I will leave it. 
# WAIT. Security Best practice: ignore live_config.json if it has secrets?
# The user wants to "copy paste" and "clone". If I ignore it, they can't clone the config.
# I will NOT ignore live_config.json for now, but I will warn them.
# Actually, I added secrets to .env (which IS ignored) and updated the checklist to generate .env on the server.
# So I SHOULD ignore .env.
